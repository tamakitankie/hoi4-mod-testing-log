# HOI4 1.17.3 Graphics Override Bug Documentation

**Critical engine bug in Hearts of Iron IV 1.17.3** - Visual overrides (colors, portraits) fail to apply despite mods loading correctly.

## ⚠️ Core Issue ⚠️ ## 
HOI4 1.17.3 loads mods but **completely ignores visual overrides**. The game:
- ✓ Reads and parses mod files correctly
- ✓ Shows mods as enabled in launcher
- ✗ **Fails to apply any visual changes** (colors, portraits, graphics)
- ✗ Even direct edits to vanilla files are ignored

## 📋 System Information
- **OS**: Windows 11 Pro (fresh install)
- **HOI4 Version**: 1.17.3 (confirmed checksum)
- **Game Build**: Steam version
- **Testing Date**: 2026-02-09

## 🔍 Comprehensive Testing Performed

### System-Level Troubleshooting
- ✓ Complete Windows 11 fresh wipe & reinstall
- ✓ Fresh HOI4 install from Steam
- ✓ All dependencies reinstalled (DirectX, VC++, .NET)
- ✓ File permissions fixed (full control to Paradox folders)
- ✓ Windows Defender exclusions added

### Modding-Specific Testing
- ✓ Correct file encoding (UTF-8 without BOM, Unix LF)
- ✓ Both old (common/leaders/) and new portrait systems tested
- ✓ Verified 1.17.3 portrait system structure (gfx/leaders/portraits.txt)
- ✓ Nuclear cache clearing (custom scripts)
- ✓ Mod loading verification (confirmed via syntax errors)

### Test Results
| Test Type | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| Color Override | Germany → Red | Germany → Black | ✗ FAIL |
| Portrait Override | Hitler → Churchill | No change | ✗ FAIL |
| Vanilla File Edit | Direct change applied | Change ignored | ✗ FAIL |
| Mod Loading | Syntax errors shown | Errors appear | ✓ PASS |

## 🛠️ Tools & Scripts Created
- **Cache clearing scripts** (Python/PowerShell)
- **Dependency installer** (DirectX, VC++, .NET)

- **Mod creation automation**

## 📊 Current Status

## 🎯 Key Insight
